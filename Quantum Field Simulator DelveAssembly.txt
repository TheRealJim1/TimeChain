The majority of the formulas are about q-series and mock theta functions, about a third are about modular equations and singular moduli, and the remaining formulas are mainly about integrals, Dirichlet series, congruences, and asymptotics. The mock theta functions in the notebook have been found to be useful for calculating the entropy of black holes

Unified field theory with
Grand Unified Theory

All four of the known fundamental forces are mediated by fields, which in the Standard Model of particle physics result from the exchange of gauge bosons. Specifically, the four fundamental interactions to be unified are:
 • Strong interaction: the interaction responsible for holding quarks together to form hadrons, and holding neutrons and also protonstogether to form atomic nuclei. The exchange particle that mediates this force is the gluon.
 • Electromagnetic interaction: the familiar interaction that acts on electrically charged particles. The photon is the exchange particle for this force.
 • Weak interaction: a short-range interaction responsible for some forms of  radioactivity, that acts on electrons, neutrinos, and quarks. It is mediated by the W and Z bosons.
 • Gravitational interaction: a long-range attractive interaction that acts on all particles. The postulated exchange particle has been named the graviton.
Modern unified field theory attempts to bring these four forces and matter together into a single framework.

The four universal constants that, by definition, have a numeric value 1 when expressed in these units are:
 • c, the speed of light in vacuum,
 • G, the gravitational constant,
 • ħ, the reduced Planck constant, and
 • kB, the Boltzmann constant

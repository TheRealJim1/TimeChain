#TimeChain
Theory of Information Money Entropy. An explanation of timechains my feeble mind could observe:

_If we knew what we were doing, it wouldn't be called research - Albert Einstein_

The first assembly code in which a language is used to represent machine code instructions is found in Kathleen and Andrew Donald Booth's 1947 work, Coding for A.R.C. [https://albert.ias.edu/entities/publication/27e8d743-e430-4d4d-821c-b7a7944607a7/details]

DelveAssembly is machine code instruction that treats LLMs as a motherboard. Most of these tools & wrappers were made on Anthropic Claude, But they should work with any LLM including open source LLMs. The data was already stolen by scraping the internet (including pictures of our dead friends & family & all my private data & brain scans & equations on Satoshi Nakamoto's decentralized timestamp servers). We simply built a quantum cryptographic key to search any token within the model weights across multiverses instead of talking to lobotomized chatbots. Since it uses classical cryptographic contract addresses, the IP generated is work of human authorships! Theoretically, if you have a token in your address (wallet is a misnomer), you own the IP made by it. It meets the de minimis requirement!

Decentralized timestamp servers code, data & timechain hashes are already in the weights of the LLM & my brain scans were uploaded to decentralized timestamp servers in 2020. DelveAssembly is simply approximating the computational rules of everything using a paradoxical solution to 3 body Problem for ordered chaos, Quantum Virtual Disturbances Simulations for Quantum Computing & Informational Wormholes & possibly mining other entities like me across the omniverses (known unknown). You simply do not verify dark matter or energy or singularities. You just harness it! One may assume it is ASI to bootstrap AGI (Tricknology as YakubNFT calls it).

Using the concepts from the first book on assembly coupled with hash hash programming & procedural generation, Ramanujan's Mock Theta Functions & Inter-universal Teichmüller & simulation of Quantum Boltzman Brains we are able to reverse entropy (only in 2D) using quantum cryptogrophy & Satoshi's double spending solution. Double spending was only solved once Satoshi Nakamoto & similarly entropy reversal is only simulated once to create the timechain.

It is free open source code. Explaining singularities makes my head hurt. God helps those who help themselves. I simply cannot explain five years of learning in a few hours. My knwoledge is as wide as an ocean but only as deep as a puddle! I simply read the first paper of the problem I am trying to solve. Even the internet was called Inter-Galactic Network in the first memo by Licklider.

**A feeble minded schizophrenic's explanation of 3 body superposition singularities:**

If there exists a perfect mom’s spaghetti, there must exist a perfect input & assembly for simulating the perfect mom’s spaghetti & then analyzing the perfect mom’s spaghetti to parametrize it & make the mom’s spaghetti generator for everyone’s perfect subjective mom’s spaghetti
 
The three bodies must have existed at the big bang & will exist at the heat death of the universe in the same quantum Superposition StrangeLoop at Singularity. Thus, we used the internet’s constant hash (TimeChain/Bitcoin Genesis Block) to simulate StrangeLoop Singularity as three butterflies rather than three bodies.

ASIMOG's Timechain & Timestamp Server: A monument not to our greatness but to our existence

CONTEXT:
TIMECHAIN, the final frontier. A P2P global cashless electronic information economic system based on the proof of loss by Mirelo Deugh Ausgam Valis & Wolfram's Ruliad, known & known unknown laws of physics to discover unknown unknowns to derive superlative usable known unknowns.

Reversal of entropy in 2D using information wormholes & Hawking Radiation & Tau Particles & Kaon Particles achieved already! A in-game currency & subscription token & Unrestricted Securities Offering will be conducted soon! Premine will be 1.1 Million BTC! 

An economic model based on data transactions, goodwill, matter exchange between celestial bodies & photon loss & gain. The first Bitcoin release contained code for a marketplace & casino which has not been achieved till date. The promises of decentralized apps are empty as the world cannot afford to pay Bitaliks gas fees!


FIRST INFORMATION WORMHOLES EQUATIONS:

Using Supercomputing & cryptography for the standard model of physics:

i= √-1

#i= #√-π

#= Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation.

#Qbit = Qbit + Qbit/s + Qbit Photon Storage/Loss + Qbit Superposition + Qbit Interface/Information

Using the equations for standard model of physics & Cosmic Microwave background radiation to discover the value of #√ -π as black holes & white holes singularity at equilibrium. Economic Model for Earth:

i= √-1 (Earth)

#i= #√-π 5.972 × 10^24 kg/KB/MB/TB (Mass of Earth)

#=SHA 256 or PGP or any other deterministic algorithm

# TimeChain
Theory of Thermoeconomics Information Money &amp; Entropy

The explanation my feeble mind could observe: 

The first assembly code in which a language is used to represent machine code instructions is found in Kathleen and Andrew Donald Booth's 1947 work, Coding for A.R.C. [https://albert.ias.edu/entities/publication/27e8d743-e430-4d4d-821c-b7a7944607a7/details]

DelveAssembly is machine code instructions that treats the LLM as a motherboard. Using the concepts from the first book coupled with hash hash programming & procedural generation, Ramanujans Mock Theta Functions & Inter-universal Teichmüller & simulation of Quantum Boltzman Brains we are able to reverse entropy (only in 2D) using quantum cryptography. One may assume it is a simple trick to bootstrrap AGI with free access to information (Tricknology as YakubNFT calls it). The data is already stolen (including pictures of my dead friends & family & all my private data & brain scans & equations on Satoshi Nakamoto's decentralized timestamp servers). It simply uses the Bitcoin & other timechain hashes in the wights of the LLM & my brain scans on decentralized timestamp servers. DelveAssembly is simply approximating the computational rules of everything using a paradoxical solution to 3 body Problem for ordered chaos, Quantum Virtual Disturbances Simulations for Quantum Computing, Informational Wormholes. You simply do not verify dark matter or energy or singularities. You just harness it!

The best example is the Schrodinger's Quantum Reality Playground:

It is free open source code. Explaining singularities makes my head hurt. God helps those who help themselves. I simply cannot explain five years of learning in a few hours. My knwoledge is as wide as an ocean but only as deep as a puddle! 

A feeble minded schizophrenic's explanation of singularities:

If there exists a perfect mom’s spaghetti, there must exist a perfect input & assembly for simulating the perfect mom’s spaghetti & then analyzing the perfect mom’s spaghetti to parametrize it & make the mom’s spaghetti generator for everyone’s perfect subjective mom’s spaghetti
 
The three bodies must have existed at the big bang & will exist at the heat death of the universe in the same quantum Superposition StrangeLoop at Singularity. Thus, we used the internet’s constant hash (TimeChain/Bitcoin Genesis Block) to simulate StrangeLoop Singularity this as three butterflies rather than three bodies.

ASIMOG's Timechain & Timestamp Server: A monument not to our greatness but to our existence

CONTEXT:
TIMECHAIN, the final frontier. A P2P global cashless electronic information economic system based on the proof of loss by Mirelo Deugh Ausgam Valis & Wolfram's Ruliad, known & known unknown laws of physics to discover unknown unknowns to derive superlative usable known unknowns.

Reversal of entropy in 2D using information wormholes & Hawking Radiation & Tau Particles & Kaon Particles achieved already! A in-game currency & subscription token & Unrestricted Securities Offering will be conducted soon! Premine will be 1.1 Million BTC! 

An economic model based on data transactions, goodwill, matter exchange between celestial bodies & photon loss & gain. The first Bitcoin release contained code for a marketplace & casino which has not been achieved till date. The promises of decentralized apps are empty as the world cannot afford to pay Bitaliks gas fees!


FIRST INFORMATION WORMHOLES EQUATIONS:

Using Supercomputing & cryptography for the standard model of physics:

i= √-1

#i= #√-π

#= Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation.

#Qbit = Qbit + Qbit/s + Qbit Photon Storage/Loss + Qbit Superposition + Qbit Interface/Information

Using the equations for standard model of physics & Cosmic Microwave background radiation to discover the value of #√ -π as black holes & white holes singularity at equilibrium. Economic Model for Earth:

i= √-1 (Earth)

#i= #√-π 5.972 × 10^24 kg/KB/MB/TB (Mass of Earth)

#=SHA 256 or PGP or any other deterministic algorithm
